## Agenda

* What does FRC programming do  
  * Make best/smoothest driving experience for the drivers  
    * Reduce amount of thinking and time wasted during the game  
    * We do that through optimizing driving and automating tasks  
  * Score as much points in autonomous 15 second period  
    * Good autonomous can make a bad robot perform good  
* Structure  
  * All project files stored on Github, project management software like Bild  
  * Vision code is on the coprocessors, robot control code is on the roborio  
* roboRIO  
  * Most important part of the robot  
  * Should always be accessible  
  * Can be plugged into a computer through USB, ethernet, or WiFi  
* Driver Station  
  * Press enter to disable  
  * Press space to emergency stop (the robot has to restart to be enabled again)  
  * All these lights have to be green for it it work  
* Phoenix Tuner X  
  * Can be used to control or monitor motors, here's how to do it  
  * Needs driver station to work  
* What non programmers need to know (remember this)  
  * We can't make the robot fly  
    * Software is not a substitute for bad hardware  
    * Hard stops \>\>\> software stops  
  * DI only has two customers: the programming team and the drive team  
  * Please ask us while designing, not after\!\!  
* Links  
  * Cheatsheets  
    * Driver Station \+ Phoenix Tuner X \+ REV Hardware Client  
    * Git  
    * WPILib VSCode \+ WPILib overview  
    * Linux  
* Homework for programming subteam  
  * Download Java, VSCode, WPILib, and Git \+ sign-in
