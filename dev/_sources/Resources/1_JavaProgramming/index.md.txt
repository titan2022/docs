## Introduction

The [official WPILib documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/) has the most amount of content regarding FRC programming. Reading through the entire Wiki will set you ahead of majority of FRC programmers. Some components do not have official WPILib support and contain their documentation externally, such as [Phoneix 6](https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/stable/) and [NavX2](https://pdocs.kauailabs.com/navx-mxp/)
