# Titan Processing

## Introduction

[Titan Processing](https://github.com/titan2022/Titan-Processing) is the official vision library created and used by Titan Robotics since the 2023-2024 season. It is targetted for compilation on a coprocessor, and for this reason it includes a networking module. The main capability is detecting AprilTags and determining the robot pose through localization and filtering it using an Extended Kalman Filter.
